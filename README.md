## OCI-RSA-ANSIBLE-KIBANA
This stack contains the [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/index.html) cluster Kibana Ansible Playbook. 
This deploys up the [Open Distro Kibana](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/kibana/) implementation 
and [Wazuh App](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app).

## Ansible Role: wazuh-kibana
We developed this role to stand the Open Distro Kibana in Wazuh cluster based on the configurations and requirements. Installs  
Kibana and Wazuh App on the target instance. Detailed information on the wazuh-kibana role and role variables can be found 
[here](/wazuh-kibana/README.md). 

## Ansible Role: wazuh-ansible
We are using <b>Galaxy</b> which provides pre-packaged units of work known to Ansible as roles and collections. Content 
from roles and collections of the <b>wazuh-ansible</b> are referenced in oci-rsa-ansible-wazuh-kibana. ThisReadme cleanup playbook 
installs and configures Wazuh agent and manager.

## Ansible Role: oci-rsa-ansible-base
Installs base packages and sets configuration for general security, monitoring, and auditing purposes. More information 
on the oci-rsa-ansible-base can be found [here](PLACEHOLDER).

## Requirements

- [Ansible core](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/index.html) >= 2.11.0
- [Oracle Autonomous Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/autonomous-linux/) >= 7.9

  purposes.
  

## Branches
* `main` branch contains the latest code.


## Usage

There are multiple ways to run Ansible playbook, but for our project we choose to pull down the bundled playbook from 
the OCI Object Storage bucket and then run the following command to configure each of the hosts locally.

```
ansible-playbook -i localhost, $OCI_RSA_BASE/${playbook_name}/main.yml --connection=local
```

An `extra_variables.yml` file is required to set the variables below. Here, the OpenDistro elasticsearch admin password, OpenDistro Kibana password
and Wazuh password can be set by the user.
```
opendistro_kibana_password: "${}"
opendistro_admin_password: "${}"
wazuh_password: "${}"
```
This is a wrapper which configures the Wazuh cluster. To deploy the infrastructure and configure the cluster on instance nodes,
our team recommends a specific workflow. Detailed explanation of the recommended workflow can be found [here](WORKFLOW.md).
