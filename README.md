## OCI-RSA-ANSIBLE-KIBANA
This stack contains the [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/index.html) cluster Kibana Ansible Playbook. 
This deploys up the [Open Distro Kibana](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/kibana/) implementation 
and [Wazuh App](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app).

## Ansible Role: wazuh-kibana
We developed this role to stand the Open Distro Kibana in Wazuh cluster based on the configurations and requirements. Installs  
Kibana and Wazuh App on the target instance. Detailed information on the wazuh-kibana role and role variables can be found 
[here](/wazuh-kibana/README.md). 

## Ansible Role: wazuh-ansible
We are using <b>Galaxy</b> which provides pre-packaged units of work known to Ansible as roles and collections. Content 
from roles and collections of the <b>wazuh-ansible</b> are referenced in oci-rsa-ansible-wazuh-kibana. This playbook 
installs and configures Wazuh agent and manager.

## Ansible Role: oci-rsa-ansible-Base
Installs base packages and sets configuration for general security, monitoring, and auditing purposes. More information 
on the oci-rsa-ansible-base can be found [here](PLACEHOLDER).

## Requirements

- [Ansible core](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/index.html) >= 2.11.0
- [Oracle Autonomous Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/autonomous-linux/) >= 7.9

## Usage
This playbook deploys [Open Distro Kibana](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/kibana/)
implementation as well as the [Wazuh APP](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app).

To run this playbook, this repository needs to be bundled up with the required collections and roles and uploaded to an 
object storage bucket as a tgz file.

Assuming you have cloned the repo and are in the repository root:

Command to install the ansible roles
```
ansible-galaxy install --ignore-certs -r requirements.yml -p ./.galaxy-roles
```

Command to bundle up the playbook. Here the `playbook_zip` variable is `target_dir/playbook_name`
```
tar -czf $playbook_zip $playbook_name
```

Command to upload the tar file to object storage
```
oci os object put -ns $namespace -bn $bucketname --file $playbook_zip --name ${playbook_name}.tgz
```

After terraform provisions the instances, the bootstrapping script pulls the appropriate tar file from object store and 
runs the playbook.

Because we are not using ansible inventory to run the playbooks, the bootstrapping script runs the following command to 
launch the playbook directly on each of the hosts locally.

```
ansible-playbook -i localhost, $OCI_RSA_BASE/${playbook_name}/main.yml --connection=local
```

An `extra_variables.yml` file is required to set the variables below. These values are randomly generated by terraform 
and sent to the instances during bootstrapping. Here, the OpenDistro elasticsearch admin password, OpenDistro Kibana password
and Wazuh password can be overridden by the user.
```
opendistro_kibana_password: "${}"
opendistro_admin_password: "${}"
wazuh_password: "${}"
```
